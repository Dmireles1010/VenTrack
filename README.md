# VenTrack: A Vending Machine Tracker App

## Overview
Our system is a vending machine tracker. We can log into the system and use it to control the vending machine, retrieve information from vending machines, and change some of its attributes. Our idea about this project comes from the ubiquitous trends in vending machines, especially in Japan. With hundreds of vending machines placed around areas, it would be difficult for vending machine owners to keep track of the revenue, items sold, etc. This system will be able to provide up-to-date information on their products, convenience, and ease of access to the companies that own the vending machines.

## Features
Some of the features included in our program are:
- Viewing stats of individual vending machines
- Viewing overall vending machine stats
- Listing number of items sold from vending machine
- Modifying vending machine items
